  <NarkoataTolerance.description>This drug was created in the tropics from tea leaves, which cause hallucinations when set on fire. They were found by space scientists on the planet Zeme 1444-B, where tribes using this drug were discovered. Residents said that when setting fire to normcoats, the spirits of the forest endow him with speed, agility, fearlessness and the ability to see in the dark. At the beginning of the production of the drug, the manager liked the design and he decided to leave it.
